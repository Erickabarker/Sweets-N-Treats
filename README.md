## _Design_

### Colour scheme

I used [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to choose a colour scheme that would be easy to read and contrasting with background images.

### Typography

Courier New, Courier, monospace is used as it is easy to read and inkeeping with simplistic design in which the website is based on. 

### Wireframes

For each of the sections in the scrolling webpage I used balsamiq to create wireframes.
